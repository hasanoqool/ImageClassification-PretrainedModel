# ImageClassification-TransferLearning
Classification and Transfer Learning for images

# Overview
* This repo consists of 6 main topics:
    * Creating a binary classifier to detect smiles (positive, negative)
    * Creating a multi-class classifier to play Rock Paper Scissors
    * Creating a multi-label classifier to label watches
    * Implementing ResNet from scratch
    * Classifying images with a pre-trained network using the Keras API & TensorFlow Hub
    * Using data augmentation to improve performance with the Keras API, tf.data and tf.image APIs

#

## Running detect_smiles.py
* Train a smile classifier from scratch on the <b>SMILEs dataset</b>.
